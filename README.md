# A toast to you!  
A little game I made to learn p5 and practice DOM manipulation.

How it works:
* you can play the game online on this website: https://zikaden.github.io/w3_toast_game/
* make sure to open it in an inkognito window or disable all add-blockers
* you can turn the music on and off by clicking on the music button
* click on the glass to get jam
* spread it on the toast
* any jam not on the toast will score minus points
* the score and time will reset when you click on the glass again
* repeat
